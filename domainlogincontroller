// This will check the domain of the Sign in with Ethereum message and compare it to the domain specified in the returnValueTest. In this case, the domain must match "localhost:3050". This condition is useful to prevent signature reuse across domains. 
// You can use the "AND" operator with Boolean Logic to add this condition to any other condition which will prevent using signatures from other domains.
